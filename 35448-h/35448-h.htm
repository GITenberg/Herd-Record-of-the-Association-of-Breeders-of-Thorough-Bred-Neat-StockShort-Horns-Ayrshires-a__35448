<h2>NOTICE.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Owing</span> to circumstances beyond the control of the Committee of
Publication, or of the Committees on the Pedigrees of the various
classes of stock, it has been impossible to publish the first volume of
the Herd Record of the Association of Breeders of Thorough-bred
Neat Stock at an earlier day. The desire to obtain as large a representation
of stock as possible, and to extend the advantages of the
Association as widely among breeders as they could, has induced the
committees on the various classes of stock to hold open their books,
and the delays incident upon tracing doubtful pedigrees, through in
many instances a long correspondence with owners and breeders, have
prevented them from furnishing the copy to the Publication Committee
in season to have the work finished sooner. Every care has been
taken to have the records perfect, and to admit no pedigrees of doubtful
character. It is believed this has been successfully accomplished, and
that the animals here recorded may be relied upon as of undoubted
purity of blood.</p>

<h2>SHORT HORNS.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> pure, improved Short Horn, having become an established variety
of Neat Stock for useful and farm purposes throughout the Northern and
Western States, and proved themselves to be all that can reasonably be
expected of them when established on soil productive of an abundance
of grass, it is desirable to preserve their blood as pure as possible, and
the animals herein inserted have had their pedigrees examined and approved
by the Committee appointed for that purpose. It must be admitted
that the Short Horns present themselves to notice under circumstances
of peculiar interest; possessing in themselves a combination of
desirable qualities, and rendered attractive to the eye by their splendid
frames, and beautiful varied colors, it is not surprising they have become
objects of public interest. Great temptation is laid before a class of
men to manufacture <i>pure bloods</i> to suit their purposes, being able to
afford them at a much less price than a genuine article. Great facilities
are within the reach of all at the present day, who desire to become acquainted
with their history and their great performance at the shambles,
and for the dairy, and general usefulness as farm stock.</p>

<p>The beef producers, and beef dealers uniformly acknowledge their
great superiority over common stock. In the month of November, 1817,
the improved Durham Short Horn Bull, Young Denton, (963) then
sixteen months old, arrived in Boston, sent out from England by Samuel
Williams, of London, a present to his brother Stephen Williams, of
Northboro', Worcester Co., Mass.; he remained there until 1827 or 1828,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
when he was taken to the State of Maine, where he died, April 16, 1830.
His Sire was Denton, (198); his G. Sire Comet, (155); was sold for
1000 guineas in 1810. In 1822, Mr. Williams received the Short Horn
Cow, Arabella, from the same source; her Sire was North Star, (460);
Dam, Aurora by Comet, (155). Both of these animals were bred by that
eminent breeder, John Wetherel, who was one of the four spirited purchasers
of Comet (155) in 1810, at the price before mentioned. It has
been claimed by those who have gone before us, that Young Denton
(963) was the first improved Durham Short Horn Bull, imported into
the United States. From these two imported animals sprang a very
numerous progeny, and their descendants are scattered through all of
the Northern States. In 1823 the Bull Admiral, (1608) and Cow Arabella,
were sent out from the same herd as a present from Admiral Sir
Isaac Coffin, to the Massachusetts Agricultural Society, who placed them
under the charge of E. Hersey Derby, Esq., of Salem, Mass., who bred
from them successfully a few years, when the stock on hand was sold and
removed to Hartford Co., Conn. Many animals of the present day, trace
back to this importation. About the same period, Israel Monson, Esq.,
of Boston, a large landholder, brought out the Cow, Tube Rose, also from
the herd of Mr. Wetherel. She produced but one Heifer in this country,
(Rose by Young Denton), which, with her Mother and Daughter,
(Nellie by Admiral, (1608)) died about the year 1830.</p>

<p>In 1823. Mr. John S. Skinner, then editor of the American Farmer,
Baltimore, imported two Heifers, Conquest and Pansey, and a Bull,
Washington, (1566) for Gen. Stephen Van Renselaer, of Albany, N. Y.,
all from the herd of Mr. Champion, Blythe, England. Many of their
descendants are recorded in this book, and are scattered through all the
Northern States. All of the above mentioned animals possessed a very
high order of excellence for milking capacity, both quality and quantity,
and their descendants maintain that character in a very high degree at
the present day.</p>

<p>In 1829, Mr. Benjamin Rodman, of New Bedford, Mass., imported
three Heifers, Adaliza, Dulcibella, and Galatea, and a Bull, Devonshire,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
(966) bred by Mr. Whitaker, of Burley, Yorkshire,&mdash;these were selected
by Mr. Francis Rotch, then in England. One of them, Dulcibella was
in calf when purchased, and produced Dew Drop, by Charles, (878)
from which has sprung a numerous family of Cows, celebrated for their
superior dairy qualities.</p>

<p>In 1830, Mr. Enoch Silsby, of Boston, Mass., sent to England and
brought out the Cow, Boston, by Sir Charles, (1440) and Bull, Boston,
(1735) both bred by Mr. Curry, of Brandon. These animals left a
numerous progeny, justly celebrated for strong constitutions as well as
rich handling and dairy qualities; many of their descendants are also
recorded in this book.</p>

<p>It is not claimed the instances of Short Horn excellence herein
cited are superior to many others; they are those that have been
noted and the facts made public.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Beef Qualities.</i></div>

<p>In 1843 a thorough bred Heifer, Regina, three years and a half old,
having nursed her calf through the summer, was in thin flesh in the
fall. Her bag having been deformed by accident, and she not being in
calf, was put into a distillery stall in November, fed on slops and
straw, and slaughtered in April following, and her dressed weight,
beef, hide and tallow, 1005 pounds; beef of the finest quality.</p>

<p>In 1857, Lucy, a thorough bred Heifer, was turned to pasture with
reference to making beef of her, she having proved barren, being then
nearly four years old. She was put into the stable in November, fed
on good hay and a very small quantity of meal, it being the design to
feed her a long time. On the fourth day of January following she was
sold to a butcher for ten dollars per cwt., estimated at 1,000 pounds. She
was slaughtered at Hartford, Conn., being four years and five months
old, having eaten less than <i>two bushels</i> of meal in her life. Her beef
was sold, all the prime pieces at twenty-five cents per pound; was a
very beautiful animal, with handling properties of the very highest order
of excellence.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>In the month of January, 1862, Pocahontas, a thorough bred Heifer,
was sold and slaughtered, then five years and one month old. Her
dressed weight was as follows: hide, ninety pounds; tallow, one hundred
and twenty-seven pounds; quarters, eleven hundred and eighteen
pounds; total dressed weight, thirteen hundred and thirty-five pounds;
was sold for eight cents per pound, making $106.80. Her feed, other
than hay and grass, being twenty and one-half bushels of meal in all.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Dairy Qualities.</i></div>

<p>Lucilla, a thorough bred Heifer, at four years old, gave in June fifty-five
pounds of milk on an average for one month; her greatest yield
in one day was fifty-nine pounds and eight ounces, and during this
month yielded fourteen pounds and eight ounces of butter in one
week; her feed, grass, with three quarts of meal daily. At five years
old the first week in June, her milk yielded fifteen pounds three ounces
of butter, on grass only.</p>

<p>Dorothy, a thorough bred Cow, gave thirty-nine pounds eight ounces
of milk per day, three months after calving, on grass only; and in
seven days made fifteen pounds one ounce of butter, in October.</p>

<p>Nymph 5th, in the month of June, 1860, gave twenty-four quarts
of milk daily for two weeks in succession, and made butter at the rate
of two pounds four ounces per day, or fifteen pounds three ounces per
week, on grass only.</p>

<p>Rose 2d, a thorough bred Cow, produced seventeen pounds four
ounces of butter from one week's milk in June, on grass only.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Longevity.</i></div>

<p>Princess, a thorough bred Cow, bred regularly up to eighteen years
old; was then dried off and turned to grass for beef, and slaughtered in
the fall without stall-feeding, and made merchantable beef.</p>

<p>Arabella, a thorough-bred Cow, bred regularly up to seventeen years
old, and died in 1861, at eighteen years old.</p>

<p>Lilac 4th, a thorough-bred Cow, bred regularly up to nineteen years
old, and died in 1861.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<h2>NOTICE.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Owing</span> to circumstances beyond the control of the Committee of
Publication, or of the Committees on the Pedigrees of the various
classes of stock, it has been impossible to publish the first volume of
the Herd Record of the Association of Breeders of Thorough-bred
Neat Stock at an earlier day.  The desire to obtain as large a representation
of stock as possible, and to extend the advantages of the
Association as widely among breeders as they could, has induced the
committees on the various classes of stock to hold open their books
and the delays incident upon tracing doubtful pedigrees, through in
many instances a long correspondence with owners and breeders, have
prevented them from furnishing the copy to the Publication Committee,
in season to have the work finished sooner.  Every care has been
taken to have the records perfect, and to admit no pedigrees of doubtful
character.  It is believed this has been successfully accomplished, and
that the animals here recorded may be relied upon as of undoubted
purity of blood.</p>

<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Committee appointed to examine and prepare for publication
pedigrees of Ayrshire Stock, having completed their labors, offer the
following as their Report.</p>

<p>In arranging the pedigrees, we have endeavored to render them
simple and exact, and to trace each animal to a direct importation. In
a few instances this latter has been impossible, and we have been obliged
to be content with tracing the pedigrees to the herds of well known
breeders, having their assurances that the animals in question were
thorough-bred Ayrshire.</p>

<p>Many breeders, who have taken the utmost pains, and have been at
great expense to keep their herds pure, have not been careful to keep
accurate records of the pedigrees of their stock, feeling that as long as
they themselves were satisfied, their assurances would be sufficient to
convince purchasers. This course answered when there were but few
cattle of this breed in the country, and the necessity of an organized
effort to preserve the purity of the blood had not been recognized; but
hereafter it is hoped that every one liberal enough to breed thorough-bred
stock, will see the advantages and the necessity of a record of pedigrees,
and assist in swelling the next edition of the work, to a size more
nearly commensurate with the importance of the subject.</p>

<p>The Committee thought best to have a short history of the Ayrshires,
together with the points given by the Ayrshire Agricultural Association,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_Sec2" id="Page_2_Sec2">[2]</a></span>
printed as an introduction to the work, and applied to Sanford Howard,
Esq., of Boston, who kindly consented to write such an article.</p>

<p>Mr. Howard's opportunities of studying this breed, both in Scotland
and in this country have been such, that he is eminently fitted to write
with authority on the subject. The Committee did not follow his suggestion
and give in the Herd Book the lists of premiums taken by the
animals at the various Agricultural Fairs, knowing that many of the
premiums in this country have been awarded for want of competition,
and by judges not acquainted with the excellencies or the peculiarities
of the breed. Should this Society ever hold exhibitions, a record of the
premiums taken at them would be of great value to breeders in selecting
animals for stock purposes.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> breed of cattle now know as the Ayrshire, undoubtedly originated
in the county of that name, in Scotland; but by what special means
it was formed cannot be particularly told. Youatt (1835) says, "A century
ago there was no such breed in Ayrshire or in Scotland;" and he asks,
"Did the [present] Ayrshire cattle arise entirely from a careful selection of
the native breed?" adding, "If they did it is a circumstance unparalleled
in the history of agriculture. The native breed may be ameliorated by
careful selection; its value may be incalculably increased; some good
qualities may for the first time be developed; but yet there will be some
resemblance to the original stock." A comparison of the modern breed
with the description given by Aiton of the cattle which he says occupied
Ayrshire fifty years before the time when he wrote (1806), will
show that the difference is great. He says, "The cows kept in the districts
of Kyle and Cunningham [districts of Ayrshire], were of a diminutive
size, ill-fed, ill-shaped, and they yielded but a scanty return in
milk; they were mostly of a black color, with stripes of white along
the chine or ridge of their backs, about their flanks and on their faces.
Their horns were high and crooked,  *  *  *  their pile
[hair] was coarse and open; and few of them yielded more than three
or four Scotch pints [six to eight wine quarts] of milk a day."</p>

<p>Those who are acquainted with the Ayrshire cattle of to-day, will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4_Sec2" id="Page_4_Sec2">[4]</a></span>
readily admit that they present a wide contrast with the old stock, according
to the above description of the latter; and the suggestion of
Youatt, that the present breed could not have arisen entirely by selection
from the old, seems reasonable. It follows, then, that the Ayrshire,
like the modern or "improved" Short Horn breed, originated in crossing.
The question as to the breeds from which it was derived, will be briefly
considered, although the attempt will not be made to give precise details
on this point.</p>

<p>Various accounts represent that the Earl of Marchmont, some time
between 1724 and 1740, introduced to his estates, in Berwickshire, some
cattle, conjectured (their history was not positively known) to be of the
Holderness or Teeswater breed, and that, not long afterwards, some of
the stock was carried to estates belonging to the same nobleman, in that
part of Ayrshire called Kyle. But, perhaps, the main nucleus of the
improved breed was the "Dunlop stock," so called, which appears to
have been possessed by a distinguished family by the name of Dunlop,
in the Cunningham District of Ayrshire, as early as 1780. This stock,
it is said, was derived, at least in part, from animals imported from Holland.
The Dunlop cows soon became noted. Rawlin (as quoted by
Youatt), who wrote in 1794, speaking of the cattle of Ayrshire,
says, "They have another breed, called the Dunlop, which are allowed
to be the best race for yielding milk in Great Britain, or Ireland,
not only for large quantities, but also for richness and quality." This,
though extravagant praise, perhaps, shows that the stock possessed remarkable
qualities at that early day. It was, indeed, held in great
esteem still earlier. In Youatt's Treatise, it is mentioned, when speaking
of the cattle of Dumfrieshire, that the poet Burns, when he occupied
a farm near the city of Dumfries, "not content with the Galloway breed,
introduced some of the West-Country cows, which he thought would produce
more milk." In the poet's published correspondence, allusion is
made, in a letter dated November 13th, 1788, to a heifer which had been
presented to him by the proprietor of Dunlop House, as "the finest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5_Sec2" id="Page_5_Sec2">[5]</a></span>
quey in Ayrshire." Mrs. Dunlop, it will be remembered, was a special
friend and correspondent of the poet.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>Col. Le Couteur, in a paper on the Jersey or Alderney cow, published
in the Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society, refers to a statement
by Quayle, that the Ayrshire was a cross of the Short Horn and Alderney;
and adds himself that "there is a considerable affinity between the
two breeds." Rawlin also says, in reference to the Ayrshire breed, "It
is said to be a mixture by bulls brought from the island of Alderney,
with their own or the old race of cows." Martin says, "At some period
or other there has evidently been a cross with the Durham or Holderness,
and, perhaps, also with the Alderney." Professor Low, in his
"Illustrations of British Quadrupeds," says, "From all the evidence
which, in the absence of authentic documents, the case admits of, the
dairy breed of Ayrshire cows, owes the characters which distinguish it
from the older race, to a mixture of the blood of the races of the continent
and of the dairy breed of Alderney."</p>

<p>So far, the authorities quoted have, doubtless, given the main facts in
regard to the originals of the present Ayrshire cattle. But there is evidence
that the present leading type of the breed was formed, in part, by
an infusion of the blood of the Kyloe, or West-Highland breed. This
appeared in the first instance, probably, in what has been called the
Swinley variety. The facts, which the writer has obtained in Scotland
in regard to it, are substantially as follows: Theophilus Parton, of Swinley
Farm, near Dairy, Ayrshire, about forty to forty-five years ago, took
great pains to establish a herd of what were deemed the <i>best</i> Ayrshire
cattle, into which he infused a strain of the West-Highland blood, the
particular degree of which is not publicly or generally known.  The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6_Sec2" id="Page_6_Sec2">[6]</a></span>
Swinley stock differs from the older Ayrshire in having a shorter head,
with more breadth across the eyes, more upright and spreading horns,
more hair, and generally better constitutions. They are also somewhat
smaller boned than the old stock, though from their superior symmetry,
and greater tendency to fatten, they are fully equal to the former in
weight of carcass when slaughtered.</p>

<p>The following points given by the Ayrshire Agricultural Association,
1853, "as indicating superior quality," will give an idea of the standard
for Ayrshire cattle, as recognized by the leading breeders:</p>

<p>Head short, forehead wide, nose fine between the muzzle and the eyes;
muzzle moderately large, eyes full and lively, horns widely set on, inclining
upwards and curving slightly inwards.</p>

<p>Neck long and straight from the head to the top of the shoulders, free
from loose skin on the underside, fine at its junction with the head, and
the muscles symmetrically enlarging towards the shoulders.</p>

<p>Shoulders thin at the top, brisket light, the whole fore-quarter thin in
front and gradually increasing in depth and width backwards.</p>

<p>Back short and straight, spine well defined, especially at the shoulders,
short ribs arched, the body deep at the flanks, and the milk-veins well
developed.</p>

<p>Pelvis long, broad and straight, hook [or hip] bones wide apart, and
not much overlaid with fat, thighs deep and broad, tail long and slender,
and set on a level with the back.</p>

<p>Milk-vessel [udder] capacious and extending well forward, hinder-part
broad and firmly attached to the body, the sole or under surface
nearly level. The teats from two to two and a half inches in length,
equal in thickness, and hanging perpendicularly; their distance apart at
the sides should be equal to about one-third the length of the vessel,
and across to about one-half the breadth.</p>

<p>Legs short, the bones fine and the joints firm.</p>

<p>Skin soft and elastic, and covered with soft, close and woolly hair.</p>

<p>The colors preferred are brown, or brown and white, the colors being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7_Sec2" id="Page_7_Sec2">[7]</a></span>
distinctly defined. Weight of the animal, when fattened, about forty
imperial stones, sinking the offal [that is 560 pounds], the quarters or
meat only.</p>

<p>From what has already been said, it will be understood, that the dairy
is the leading object with the breeders of Ayrshires. At the same time
the fact has not been overlooked, that to breed and perpetuate a profitable
dairy stock, regard must be had to hardiness and strength of constitution,
and also to such fattening tendencies as will insure a profitable
return from calves fattened for veal, from steers reared for beef, and for
cows, which having served their turn in the dairy, are at last dried of
their milk and prepared for the shambles. The importance of these
properties is not sufficiently regarded by keepers of dairy stock in this
country. The remark has not unfrequently been heard that the "<i>looks</i>
of a cow are nothing." People who hold this absurd notion will never
be distinguished for breeding profitable dairy stock. Even if milk were
the sole object, it would be impossible to preserve a breed possessing superior
qualities, in this respect, without giving attention to those points
of form which denote strength of constitution. It has been well observed
by Magne, that in the breeding of dairy stock, we should "make choice
only of animals possessing the <i>two-fold character of general vigor, and
activity of the mammary system</i>."</p>

<p>The leading breeders of Ayrshire, in Scotland, have followed these
principles to some extent, if not to the full degree to which they should
be observed. Hence, they claim a high rank for the breed in reference
to general usefulness. Aiton, speaking of what the Ayrshire cow would
do, says, "She yields much milk, and that of an oily or butyraceous, or
caseous nature, and after she has yielded very large quantities of milk
for several years, she shall be as valuable for beef as any other breed of
cows known; her fat shall be much more mixed through the whole flesh,
and she shall fatten faster than any other." Whatever may be said in regard
to the extent of these claims, it will be admitted that they indicate the
confidence which was long ago placed in the breed in regard to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8_Sec2" id="Page_8_Sec2">[8]</a></span>
properties mentioned. Youatt, who wrote twenty-five years after Aiton,
says, "The breed has been much improved since Mr. Aiton described
it." It is thirty years since Mr. Youatt made this remark,
and in this time the breed has been still further improved in reference to
general usefulness. I have been assured by some of the most experienced
breeders in Scotland, that while nothing has been lost on the score
of dairy properties, considerable has been gained in hardiness and thrift,
and in the faculty of giving a greater return, both in milk and flesh, for
the food consumed. Of course it is the return obtained in proportion to
the food eaten, that constitutes the true criterion of value in all animals.</p>

<p>In Scotland, the calves of the Ayrshire breed, that are not wanted for
keeping up the breeding or dairy stock, are either fattened for veal, or
turned for beef at an early age. The larger portion, perhaps, of the males
are killed for veal. In fact, in some districts, veal is an article of considerable
importance, and the ability of Ayrshire cows to make fat
calves is considered one of the excellencies of the breed. Thus Haxton
observes, "For all medium soils and climates throughout the United
Kingdom, there is no breed equal to the Ayrshire, for profit, whether
the produce is converted into cheese, butter, or <i>veal</i>." A portion of the
males are castrated and fattened when about three to three and half years
old. Scotch farmers, who are in the practice of fattening stock of various
breeds, assured me that Ayrshire steers of this age fattened to as much
profit as any, reaching the weight of 700 to 800 pounds the four quarters,
and afforded beef excelled in quality only by the Galloways and
the West-Highlanders.</p>

<p>At present the Ayrshire cattle have not been tried in America to a
great extent. There have been various importations, mostly made
within the last twenty years, and so far as there have been such trials
as would justify a conclusion in regard to their merits, they have answered
all reasonable expectations. The leading object in keeping them
here is the same as it is in Scotland&mdash;the dairy&mdash;but their ability to fatten
readily and make beef of good quality, should be taken into consideration<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9_Sec2" id="Page_9_Sec2">[9]</a></span>
in estimating their value. In regard to the latter property, but
few trials have as yet been made here. Most of the males have been
kept for bulls, and the females have seldom been fattened till too far advanced
in years to breed. It may be worthy of consideration, whether
it would not be an object to give some good steers of the breed a fair
chance to show what they could make in beef at three to four years
old.</p>

<p>It is also desirable to ascertain what are the capabilities of the breed
in regard to the performance of labor. On this point we are without
any evidence from abroad, as oxen are not worked in Scotland. The
results of the few trials that have been made with full-bloods, have been
highly favorable in reference to the qualities of the breed for this purpose.
Judging by their points, there is no reason why Ayrshire oxen
should not be equal to any others, of their size, for any kind of labor.
They have clean, firm legs, well-placed muscles, and are remarkably
quick walkers.</p>

<p>The advantages of a Registry, or Herd Book, for this breed of cattle,
are too obvious to require argument. For the Short Horns, Herefords,
and Devons, registers have been prepared, and the benefits which
have been derived therefrom are such as will insure their continuance.
An accurate record of the pedigrees of animals, together with a record
of such premiums as they may have taken, cannot fail to afford a guide,
to some extent, in breeding with reference to special objects&mdash;the principle,
that "Like begets Like," being admitted as a general law. The
subject of publishing a Herd Book for Ayrshires, in Scotland, has been
agitated on several occasions, but, down to the present time, no direct
action has been taken on it. The enterprise of the American breeders
of this variety of cattle, in taking the lead in this matter, is highly
creditable, and, if properly followed up, will be sure to bring a just
recompense of reward.</p>

<h2>NOTICE.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Owing</span> to circumstances beyond the control of the Committee of
Publication, or of the Committees on the Pedigrees of the various
classes of stock, it has been impossible to publish the first volume of
the Herd Record of the Association of Breeders of Thorough-bred
Neat Stock at an earlier day.  The desire to obtain as large a representation
of stock as possible, and to extend the advantages of the
Association as widely among breeders as they could, has induced the
committees on the various classes of stock to hold open their books
and the delays incident upon tracing doubtful pedigrees, through in
many instances a long correspondence with owners and breeders, have
prevented them from furnishing the copy to the Publication Committee,
in season to have the work finished sooner. Every care has been
taken to have the records perfect, and to admit no pedigrees of doubtful
character. It is believed this has been successfully accomplished, and
that the animals here recorded may be relied upon as of undoubted
purity of blood.</p>

<h2>HISTORY OF THE DEVONS.</h2>


<div class='center'><i>Ancient Races.</i></div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> preparing the following article, we have consulted the principal
Agricultural Reports and Journals of this country, and Youatt, and
Martin, and Low's histories of British Cattle; we are also indebted to
many of our importers and breeders, who have furnished statements in
regard to their respective herds. That the Devons are an ancient race
of cattle, there can be no doubt. There is no race in England that can
claim such undisputed antiquity. They bear all the characteristic
marks of resemblance of the ancient races of the south of England and
Wales; even the color, red, is traced in the Devon, Sussex and Hereford.</p>

<p>The distinction between a "breed" and "race," Goodale defines as
follows: "By breeds are understood such varieties as were originally
produced by a cross or mixture, and subsequently established by selecting
for breeding purposes only the best specimens, and rejecting all
others. In process of time deviations become less frequent, and greater
uniformity is secured, and this is in proportion to the time which elapses
and the skill employed in selecting. Races are varieties moulded to
their peculiar type by <i>natural</i> causes, with no interference of man, and
no intermixture of other varieties; that have continued substantially the
same, for a period beyond which the memory and knowledge of man
does not reach. Such are the North Devon Cattle."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_Sec3" id="Page_2_Sec3">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>There seems to have been three distinct races of these ancient cattle:
the Long Horns, the Middle Horns, and Hornless, or Polled Cattle.
The Middle Horns represented the cattle of the region of Devonshire.
These races of cattle were bred by the Ancient Celtic inhabitants, and
constituted their chief subsistence. Youatt says: "the native inhabitants
were proud of their country, and prouder of their cattle, their
choicest possession." When their country was invaded by their enemies,
they fled to the mountains for safety and protection, and took
with them their cattle upon which to subsist, and thus were preserved
both themselves and their cattle, so that the races of cattle in these districts
have been the same from time immemorial. In a few instances
the wild forest cattle have been kept distinct, in a wild state, to this
day; as in the parks of Chillingham and Chartley; and are said to be
similar to those that existed in the tenth century; and also bear a strong
resemblance to the present domestic breeds of that region. The cattle
in these parks are white, with red ears.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Color.</i></div>

<p>Black or white were the principal colors, though where these were
found the memory of the red prevails. "It seems the people had a
superstitious reverence attached to it, (in Scotland and Wales), in the
tradition of the country; the milk of the red cow was considered a
remedy for every disease, and a preservative from every evil." The
breeders of the improved Devons adhere scrupulously to the deep red
color of the hair, and reject individuals that have a tendency to produce
white. And it seems that in this way, if no other, the color of the
Devons has been established and perpetuated. The deep red color of
the pure bred Devon is implanted so strongly, that there is no race in
which an admixture of foreign blood is so easily traced; nor is there a
race that has remained so free from foreign intermixture. Their color is
generally stamped on the progeny, in a cross with any other breed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_Sec3" id="Page_3_Sec3">[3]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>English Improved Devons.</i></div>

<p>The improvement of these ancient races of cattle, which has resulted
in the present perfected breed, was commenced about one hundred and
fifty years ago. John Tanner Davy, of Rose Ash, England, the Editor
of the English Devon Herd Book, inherited the herd of his father, who
had carefully bred the Devons for fifty years. Mr. Francis Quartly,
whose engraving adorns the first volume of Davy's Devon Herd Book,
endeavored by a long course of selection, and by an intimate knowledge
of the principles of breeding, to combine the various elements in the
different herds, so as to attain the great object of the Devon breeder,
the lessening of the parts of the animal frame least useful to man, as
the bone and offal, and at the same time the increase of such other parts,
as fat and flesh, that furnish food, and to do this at the earliest possible
age, and with the least consumption of food. That Mr. Quartly succeeded
in fully establishing these characteristics of the breed, we need
no better evidence than that nine-tenths of the pedigrees of the present
herds in Davy's Herd Book, go directly back to the old Quartly stock;
twenty-seven out of twenty-nine of the prize bulls mentioned in that
work are descendants from the bull Forester, (46): and twenty-nine out
of thirty-four prize cows mentioned there, descended from the cow Curly,
(92). Hundred Guinea (56), another noted ancestor of the Quartly
tribe, stands in the pedigrees of this breed, as Hubback among the
short horns. Among others who have done much to improve their
herds, and bring the breed to its present state of perfection, may be
mentioned, the Earl of Leicester, James Davy, Mr. Richard Merson,
James and John Quartly who also inherited the herds of their fathers,
and continued their well begun improvement. Mr. George Turner, of
Barton, whose herd was made up from the other breeders, Mr. Samuel
Farthing, of Somerset, Mr. John Halse, of Moland, Mr. Wm. Hole, of
Somerset, Mr. T. B. Morle, of Cummington, Mr. George Shapland, of
Oakford, and Mr. John Ayre Thomas, of Rose Ash, Devon, with many
others have caught the spirit of improvement, and continued to progress
towards perfection.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4_Sec3" id="Page_4_Sec3">[4]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Qualities.</i></div>

<p>Mr. Bloomfield, the manager of the late Earl of Leicester's estate, at
Holkam Hall, Norfolk, England, has, by careful attention, greatly improved
the size and quality of the Devons, and increased their milking
properties, so that he obtained a prize for having produced an average
annual yield of 200 pounds of butter per cow, in a dairy of twenty
cows, or equal to four pounds per week the year round; and he offered
to milk forty pure Devons from his own herd against an equal number
of cows in any one herd of any breed found in England, without finding
a competitor. At the Smithfield show of fat cattle, held at the London
market place, in 1858, the gold medal for the best ox or steer of any
breed in the show yard was awarded to a Devon, bred and owned by
the Earl of Leicester. They are highly esteemed in the Smithfield market,
not only for the excellence of the meat, but because its size is
more agreeable on most tables than the huge joints of some other breeds.
In weight they are much excelled, but the opinion of the Devon breeder
is, that more meat can be made from them, with a given amount of
food, than from any other breed. The quality of the Devon beef is
unsurpassed, even rivalling the little black West Highland ox, in the
estimation of the London west-end butcher, whose fastidious customers
oblige him to kill none but beef of the finest quality and flavor. In the
New York market the "red oxen of Connecticut" most generally bring
the highest price, they being Devon Grades. The Devons have the
preference of all other breeds for the yoke, being strong, active, and of
great endurance; and are remarkable for docility and good temper.</p>

<p>The cattle in many sections of New England resemble the Devons in
many respects, and the fact that most of the early settlers were from
the south of England, renders it quite probable that they selected their
cattle from that region. The first account that we have of the importation
of cattle into New England was in the ship Charity, in the spring
of 1623, in the care of Mr Winslow, then agent of the colony of Plymouth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5_Sec3" id="Page_5_Sec3">[5]</a></span>
Their descendants show by their color that they were Devons,
or Devon grades.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>American Improved Devons.</i></div>

<p>The first importation of improved North Devons into this country
was in 1817. Mr. Coke, then Earl of Leicester, presented to Mr. Robert
Patterson, of Baltimore, Md., six heifers and one bull, Taurus (320).
Taurus was bred by Mr. Denny, a tenant of Mr. Coke, then Earl of
Leicester, who paid fifty guineas for him. His dam, in 1820, made
thirteen pounds of butter per week. Three of these heifers Mr. Patterson
gave to his father-in-law, Mr. Richard Caton, the other three he
gave to his father, Mr. William Patterson; they were all bred to Taurus.
In 1835, Mr. George Patterson came in possession of the herd of his
father, Mr. William Patterson, and, in 1836, imported the bull Anchises
(140), for a cross, from one of the best dairies in Devonshire; he afterward
imported Eclipse (191); in 1846, Herod (214), and in 1852,
Norfolk (266). By comparing the records the fact is apparent, that
the pedigree of animals dates further back in this country than in England.
Thus the bull Taurus (320), was calved in 1816, and imported
in 1817, when a yearling, by Mr. Robert Patterson, of Md.; Holkham
(215), calved 1819; the cow Fancy (709), calved 1818, and Strawberry
1st (1062), calved 1819. While the oldest record of English pedigrees
is the bull Forester (46), calved in 1827, and Hundred Guineas (56),
calved in 1837; the cows Flower (187), calved in 1820, Countess (77),
in 1828, Curly (92), and Pretty Maid (364), were calved in 1830.
Messrs. S. &amp; L. Hurlbut, of Winchester, Conn., commenced their herd in
1819, from a pair procured of Mr. Patterson, Holkham (115), and Fancy
(709), with additions from the same source every few years. In 1850
they imported Albert (2), whose progeny has stood high in the country,
and received more premiums than the progeny of any other bull lately
imported. Beauty (523), bred by Mr. Hurlbut, in 1836, from Fancy
(709), and Exchange (197), produced sixteen pounds of butter per
week, in June, 1850.  Mr. Coleman, says, in his European Agriculture,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6_Sec3" id="Page_6_Sec3">[6]</a></span>
"the most productive cow in butter, which I have found, was a North
Devon, which, for several weeks in succession, without extra feed, produced
twenty-one pounds of butter per week. The character of the
owner places the fact beyond a doubt."</p>

<p>Mr. L. F. Allen, of Black Rock, N. Y., commenced breeding in 1835,
from stock obtained from the Hon. James L. King, of New York, whose
father imported them about the year 1819, from the herd of the Earl of
Leicester; in 1842 he added to his herd from Mr. Patterson's stock.
In 1844 the Massachusetts Society for the Promotion of Agriculture
imported four cows and one bull, Bloomfield (372), from the Earl of
Leicester.  They were boarded and bred for the Society on the farm of
Elias Phiney, of Lexington, till his death, the object being to present
a pair to each of the County Societies in the State. In 1848, Mr. C. S.
Wainwright, of Rhinebeck, N. Y., commenced importing and breeding
his herd; his first importation was the bull Megunticook (251), and the
cows Nonpareil (924), and Helena (774); Helena gave as high as twenty-two
quarts of milk per day, and made fifteen pounds of butter per
week.  In 1851 he imported May Boy (71), whose granddam, Old May
Flower, made over seventeen pounds of butter per week.  In 1853,
Mr. George Vail, of Troy, N. Y., imported one bull and two heifers
from the herds of Mr. Davy and the Earl of Leicester.  In 1850 and '52,
Col. L. G. Morris, of New York, imported animals from the herds of the
Earl of Leicester, the Messrs. Quartly and John Ayer Thomas.  Abijah
Catlin, of Conn., imported in 1851, Rubens (116), and two heifers.
Many others have imported animals equally meritorious, among whom
may be mentioned, Ambrose Stevens, of Batavia, N. Y., E. G. Faile,
West Farms, N. Y., R. Linsley, West Meriden, Conn., R. W. Sanford,
Orwell, Vt., E. P. Beck, Sheldon, N. Y., and R. H. Van Rensselaer,
of Morris, N. Y.  Importations have occurred almost annually up to
the present year.  These importations, with many others not mentioned,
are sufficient to form the basis of a superior race of Devons in America,
not excelled by those in any other country.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7_Sec3" id="Page_7_Sec3">[7]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Devon Herd Book.</i></div>

<p>The <i>First Herd Book</i> of the Devons was published in 1851, by John
Tanner Davy, of Rose Ash, near Southmolton, Devon, England. The
pedigrees of 132 bulls and 483 cows, in all 615 animals, were recorded;
all bred in England, and contributed by thirty-seven different breeders.</p>

<p>The <i>second volume</i>, published in 1854, contained the pedigrees of 221
bulls and 657 cows, 837 animals in all; and was edited by Mr. Davy,
in England, and Sanford Howard, in America, comprising animals bred
and owned in both countries, sixty breeders contributing in England,
and eighteen in America.</p>

<p>The <i>third volume</i> was published in 1859, on both sides of the Atlantic,
by Messrs. Davy and Howard, independent of each other, Mr. Davy's
third volume recorded 204 bulls and 609 cows, in all 810 pedigrees,
from forty-one different herds in England, and eight in America. Mr.
Howard's recorded 258 bulls and 399 cows, in all 657 pedigrees, from
eighty-four different herds, and all from America.</p>

<p>The whole number recorded to the end of Howard's third volume is
2150 animals, comprising 611 bulls, and 1539 cows.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>American Devon Herd Book.</i></div>

<p>The present work, the first volume of the American Devon Herd
Book, published in March, 1863, under the direction of the Association
of Breeders of Thorough-Bred Neat Stock, was commenced about two
years since. It has progressed amid many discouraging circumstances,
to say nothing of the jealousy occasioned by the locality of its origin;
and has gradually won upon public confidence till the present time. It
has been the design of the Committee on Devon pedigrees to perfect a
Devon Herd Book that would meet the wants of all American Breeders
of Devon cattle. To accomplish this they have been untiring in their
labors, sparing no pains to thoroughly investigate each pedigree; and
have decided upon each, according to the facts received from the testimony
given. While some have been rejected, others have been deferred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8_Sec3" id="Page_8_Sec3">[8]</a></span>
till more light can be given to prove their purity of blood, which
may be done in season for the second volume. How far the Committee
have accomplished their designs the present volume will show for itself.
It is a relief, however, to the Committee to know, that the errors which
may occur, can be corrected in future volumes, or the present volume
can be perfected and republished. It was also designed to make <i>this</i>
the first of a series of volumes, to be published once in four years, or as
often as the wants of the Devon breeders demand; and that would be
worthy of the title of the American Devon Herd Book, and receive the
universal patronage of all the Breeders of Devon Stock in America.</p>

<p>Considering the state of the country, and that the attention and time
of the great mass of the people are engaged in the all-absorbing and
dreadful reality, civil war, and that many of our breeders and importers
of Devon stock are personally engaged in their country's service, and
that all the Southern States of our Union have withdrawn themselves
from all connection with the Northern; considering all this, the
breeders of Thorough-Bred Devon Stock have contributed for the work
far beyond our most sanguine hopes. <i>Fifteen states</i> are represented in
this work by <i>fifty-three</i> different breeders, with the pedigrees of 151
bulls and 350 cows, making in all 501 animals which are recorded in
this volume, and all owned in America.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9_Sec3" id="Page_9_Sec3">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>The foregoing Scale of Points of Devon Cattle which the Association
has adopted, is mainly that published by the New York State Agricultural
Society, with such alterations and additions as the Committee
deemed proper. The numbers affixed to the points described form the
<i>maximum</i> that is allowed for each; and in proportion as the animal under
examination is deficient in any point, so must the number be decreased,
even should nothing be allowed for that point. Points which
are characteristic, and therefore <i>common to the breed</i>, though very valuable
in themselves, are marked comparatively low, because they are
easily obtained, and demand but little attention on the part of the
breeder; nevertheless an animal <i>not</i> possessing the characteristics of <i>the
breed</i>, must of necessity be almost worthless. On the other hand, points

her brother, during his occupancy of the farm of Ellisland, near Dumfries, kept a

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
